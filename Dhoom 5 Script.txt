A mysterious international thief, Veer (played by Hrithik Roshan), returns from hiding for one final heist – stealing a priceless AI chip from a high-security vault in Tokyo.

ACP Aryan (Abhishek Bachchan) and Ali (Uday Chopra) are reassembled by Interpol, now joined by a brilliant hacker-agent, Zara (Deepika Padukone).

Veer’s plan unfolds through high-octane bike chases across neon-lit Tokyo streets and a mind-bending virtual reality escape sequence.

A twist reveals Veer is trying to destroy the AI chip, not sell it — to prevent global surveillance by a rogue corporation.

In the end the start begins, Aryan lets Veer disappear once more, recognizing the thief as a reluctant hero, while Ali cracks a joke about retiring – again.
